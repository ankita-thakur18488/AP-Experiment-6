# Trees
A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. Unlike linear data structures like arrays and linked lists, trees are non-linear, making them ideal for representing hierarchical relationships such as file systems, database indexes, and decision-making processes.

## Tree Traversal Methods
Traversal is the process of visiting nodes in a tree.

1. Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Explores as deep as possible before backtracking.

- Preorder (Root â†’ Left â†’ Right): Used for copying a tree.
- Inorder (Left â†’ Root â†’ Right): Used in Binary Search Trees (BSTs) to retrieve sorted values.
- Postorder (Left â†’ Right â†’ Root): Used for deleting trees (deletes child nodes before the parent).

2. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Also called Level Order Traversal.
- Explores all nodes at one level before moving to the next.
